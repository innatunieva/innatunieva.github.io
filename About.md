# Inessa Tunieva

Hi there! I am Inessa, a self-taught photographer based in Hamburg. I’m always on the lookout for new and exciting ways to capture the beauty of the world through my lens. Whether it’s a stunning landscape, a majestic animal, or a beautiful person, I’m always ready to snap a photo and share it with the world.

I have a keen interest in mathematics, which I try to incorporate into my photography by implementing the golden ratio. I try to create images that are unique and memorable. If you’re looking for a photographer for your next event or just want to capture some beautiful moments, feel free to [contact me](https://innatunieva.github.io/Contact.html).

If you’re interested in supporting me, you can download my photos from [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/g/innatunieva) or [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/de/contributor/211016577/Inessa). I’d be thrilled to see my work featured in your projects! Thank you for your support!
